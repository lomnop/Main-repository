What I learned:

I learned a lot about how to manouver inside c++ and how to think when setting up a new project.
I also more clearly defined how I shuld be using cin and cout aswell as learned to use printf_s and scanf_s.

Difficulties:

I read wrong in the pyramid task and made it take an array input to make a half pyramid.
Utalizing scanf_s properly was pretty difficult to grasp at the start without any prior knowledge about how it would work.
